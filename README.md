## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By building this project, I gained experience in:

- **React Components**: Creating functional components using composition and nesting.  
- **State Management with Hooks**: Using `useState` and `useEffect` to manage component-level state.  
- **Redux Integration**: Managing global state with Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and store.  
- **Rendering Dynamic Data**: Mapping over arrays of objects to dynamically render plant cards.  
- **Event Handling & Conditional Rendering**: Managing button clicks and UI updates with user interactions.
